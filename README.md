# Airbnb Clone Project

## ðŸ“– Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive full-stack web application inspired by the functionality and design of the real-world Airbnb platform. The goal of this project is to simulate the process of building a scalable and secure booking platform from scratch, offering hands-on experience in software engineering best practices and modern web development workflows.

This project is ideal for learners and developers seeking to deepen their understanding of complex system architectures, backend and frontend integration, secure API development, and collaborative team development environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Implement a scalable and secure backend architecture
- Design and develop REST and GraphQL APIs
- Establish relational data models and relationships
- Integrate caching with Redis for performance
- Apply best practices for API authentication and security
- Lay a foundation for a future frontend integration
