## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Backend is designed around modular, scalable features that mirror the core functionality of a real-world booking platform. Below is a summary of the major features and how they contribute to the overall system:

### 👤 User Management

Handles user registration, login, authentication (JWT), and role-based access (host or guest). This ensures secure access control and sets the foundation for user-specific content like property listings and bookings.

### 🏠 Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. Includes support for pricing, availability, and descriptions — forming the core content of the platform that guests browse and book.

### 📅 Booking System

Enables guests to book available properties by selecting check-in/check-out dates and confirming reservations. It enforces availability constraints and calculates total cost, ensuring booking accuracy and preventing conflicts.

### 💳 Payment Integration

Manages payment tracking for bookings, including status updates (pending, completed, failed). Although third-party gateways are not integrated in this backend-only phase, the structure supports future integration with providers like Stripe or PayPal.

### ⭐ Review System

Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in. This feature enhances user trust and transparency by offering peer-to-peer feedback that influences future booking decisions.

### 🧾 Admin & Reporting (Planned)

An admin panel will support moderation, analytics, and data management. This includes user verification, listing approval workflows, and system health insights to aid in platform governance and operational oversight.
